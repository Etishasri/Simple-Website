                             Christie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in Torquay, Devon, and was largely home-schooled.
                             She was initially an unsuccessful writer with six consecutive rejections, but this changed in 1920 when The 
                             Mysterious Affair at Styles, featuring detective Hercule Poirot, was published. Her first husband was 
                             Archibald Christie; they married in 1914 and had one child before divorcing in 1928. Following the breakdown
                             of her marriage and the death of her mother in 1926 she made international headlines by going missing for 
                             eleven days. During both World Wars, she served in hospital dispensaries, acquiring a thorough knowledge of 
                             the poisons that featured in many of her novels, short stories, and plays. Following her marriage to 
                             archaeologist Max Mallowan in 1930, she spent several months each year on digs in the Middle East and used 
                             her first-hand knowledge of this profession in her fiction.

                            In 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America's Grand Master Award. Later
                            that year, Witness for the Prosecution received an Edgar Award for best play. In 2013, she was voted the
                            best crime writer and The Murder of Roger Ackroyd the best crime novel ever by 600 professional novelists
                            of the Crime Writers' Association. In 2015, And Then There Were None was named the "World's Favourite
                            Christie" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate. Many of Christie's books and short stories have been
                            adapted for television, radio, video games, and graphic novels. More than 30 feature films are based on her
                            work.

                            Christie's mother Clara was born in Dublin in 1854 to British Army officer Frederick Boehmer and his 
                            wife Mary Ann Boehmer. Boehmer died in Jersey in 1863, leaving his widow to raise Clara and her brothers
                            on a meagre income. Two weeks after Boehmer's death, Mary's sister Margaret West married widowed dry
                            goods merchant Nathaniel Frary Miller, a US citizen. To assist Mary financially, they agreed to foster
                            nine-year-old Clara; the family settled in Timperley, Cheshire. Margaret and Nathaniel had no children
                            together, but Nathaniel had a 17-year-old son, Fred Miller, from his previous marriage. Fred was born in
                            New York City and travelled extensively after leaving his Swiss boarding school. He and Clara were married
                            in London in 1878. Their first child, Margaret Frary ("Madge"), was born in Torquay in 1879. The second,
                            Louis Montant ("Monty"), was born in Morristown, New Jersey, in 1880, while the family was on an extended
                            visit to the United States.
